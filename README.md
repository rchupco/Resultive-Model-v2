# Resultive-Model-v2
A theoretical framework redefining clarity, time, and energy perception limits across quantum and cosmic scales.

**A reframed cosmological and informational framework** proposing that the speed of light (c) is not a universal limit, but a perceptual boundary tied to informational clarity. Time is repositioned as the sole constant across all physical scales.

## Core Concepts

- **Time as invariant**, replacing c as the structural constant
- **Clarity Gradient**: A mathematical function defining perceptual resolution across scale
- **E_field(t)**: A supplemental field-based energy component extending beyond E = mc²
- **Hubble Tension**: Explained as a clarity-based distortion artifact, not a fundamental contradiction
